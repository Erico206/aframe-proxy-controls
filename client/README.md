# Proxy Controls Remote Client

This component should be used in the *controller* application, to receive UI events from a keyboard/gamepad/leap device and forward them to a *viewer* application. Your viewer application should use [aframe-proxy-controls](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-proxy-controls), or your own implementation.
